# Assembly Language Programming Project
The repository contains the implementation of the DX-BALL game in Assembly Language, created during the first semester of the first year at the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca. 

The game is based on the classic concept of a brick-breaking game where the player controls a paddle to bounce a ball, breaking bricks arranged at the top of the screen. Players aim to clear levels by breaking all the bricks while maneuvering the paddle to keep the ball in play and avoid letting it fall off the bottom of the screen.
